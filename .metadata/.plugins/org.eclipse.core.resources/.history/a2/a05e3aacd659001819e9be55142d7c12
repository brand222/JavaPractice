	 * or constructor, java looks at the local variables instead of the
	 * variables inside the method. If a method contains a local variable with
	 * the same name as the field names, it will always default to the private
	 * variables. When you use the 'this' keyword, then you are using the actual
	 * parameter variables inside your method
